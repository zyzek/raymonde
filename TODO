* Specular Highlights
* Describe derivation of mathematical bits in comments
* Reflections (maybe with a fuzziness parameter? Is that even possible? Render surface to texture then blur?)
* Environment maps
* Transparent objects with refractive indices (Snell's law)
* Generalised object opacity, transparency, scattering
* Meshes
* Procedurally-defined objects (e.g. fractals)
* Textures (including various lighting maps)
* Ambient occlusion
* Indirect illumination
* Area lights
* Volumetrics
* Physically-based material properties
* Orientable camera
* Better way of composing scenes
* Move to GPU
* Interactive viewport / Real-time rendering
* Random pixel sampling: build up geometry with sample.
    - Intelligent ray tracing by a flood fill on the same object
    - preferentially find boundary (binary search for edge, then trace around outline)
    - incomplete areas get interpolated from surroundings until filled in


DONE:
  * Spheres
  * Diffuse Lighting w/ shadows
  * Coloured lights
  * Ambient light
