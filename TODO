* Orientable camera
* Describe derivation of mathematical bits in comments
* Lighting (diffuse, specular reflections)
    - from camera ray intersection, shoot incident ray to light sources
    - shadows: stop if occluded by objects, including ourself (move point out slighly in direction of normal)
    - proportional to intensity, albedo, inversely as the square of distance
        -- consider scatter cones or directional reflectance
* Coloured lights
* Physically-based material properties
* Reflections (maybe with a fuzziness parameter? Is that even possible? Render surface to texture then blur?)
* indirect illumination
* Transparent objects with refractive indices (Snell's law)
* Generalised object opacity, transparency, scattering
* Area lights
* Texture/environment maps
* Meshes
* Interactive viewport
* volumetrics
